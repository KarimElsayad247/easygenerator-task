## Stack

### Shared

- Package manager: `pnpm`, I prefer immensly to npm or yarn
- Build Tool: Vite.

### Backend

- Nestjs

### Frontend

- React

## What's Missing? 
- Pretty much no automated/unit testing. Between diving deep into Nest, Mongoose, Tanstack Router+Forms, etc... I Didn't have time for them.
- No API Docs, unless you count my [Yaak](https://yaak.app/) collection, which you can find in the directory `./easygen-backend/api-docs/`

  Why Yaak? Well, Postman, Insomnia, Thunderclient, etc... are all bloated. Yaak feels nice to use and doesn't require accounts.
  I can also sync my collection with git, since it's all Yaml files.
